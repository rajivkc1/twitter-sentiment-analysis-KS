# Sentiment Analysis of Kansans' Tweet: A Spatio-Temporal Approach

<details><summary> Abstract </summary><br/>

 ## Abstract

 Millions of people worldwide have used Twitter every day for expressing opinions. Whether it is an outcry of a new bill in a political region, disapproval of a hugely anticipated movie in Los Angeles, or support for a new restaurant that just opened in a neighborhood. This study focuses on the location-time variation of georeferenced Tweets’ sentiment polarity, with an aim to understanding how opinions develop on Twitter over space and time and across communities of users in the State of Kansas (KS), United States (US). This project will provide some spatial-temporal data and some insights into understanding Kansans’ sentiment variation on Twitter, which can be useful for local businesses, local lawmakers, policy analysts, and social science researchers for further Spatio-temporal statistical modeling.

 ## Goal

 The goal of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of georeferenced Twitter sentiment polarity within a ten-mile buffer around every county in the state of KS. More specifically, this study tests the sentiment of Kansans, whether positive or negative, corresponding to their tweets within the week of 11/18/2020 to 11/24/2020.

 ## Methods

 Tweets posted were assigned into 105 spatial zones each representing a different county among 105 counties in KS and a one-time zone. Sentiment analysis was then performed for each county using a manually made algorithm in R programming language which was designed to automate 100 tweets within a radius of 10 miles from an assigned geographical region and subsequently filter them into positive, negative, or neutral polarity. The sentiment polarity pattern across 105 spatial zones and one temporal region is mapped using “gglplot”, “ggplot2”, and “usmap” packages in R.
